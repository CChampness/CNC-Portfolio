## Motivation

you will want to view my work samples in so that you can assess whether I might be a good candidate to meet your requirement.

* The app presents my name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of my portfolio.
* When you view the navigation titles, you are presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, 
  and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
* When you click on a navigation title, the corresponding section is displayed without the page reloading.
* The first time the portfolio is loaded,the About Me title and section are selected by default
* When you select the About Me section, you will see a recent photo of me and a short bio about me.
* In Portfolio section, you will see titled images of six of my applications with links to both the
  deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.  Several also have walkthropugh videos.
